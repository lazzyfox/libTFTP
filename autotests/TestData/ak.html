					Many people prefer to read off-line or to print out text and read 
from the real printed page. Others want to carry documents around with 
them on their mobile phones and read while they are on the move. We have
 created .pdf files of all out documents to accommodate all these groups
 of people. We recommend that you download .pdfs onto your mobile phone 
when it is connected to a WiFi connection for reading off-line.

The wife<br>had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with<br>a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she<br>had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in<br>the same house with him. This position of affairs had now lasted<br>three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all<br>the members of their family and household, were painfully<br>conscious of it. Every person in the house felt that there was<br>so sense in their living together, and that the stray people<br>brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one<br>another than they, the members of the family and household of the<br>Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room, the husband had<br>not been at home for three days. The children ran wild all over<br>the house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper,<br>and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation<br>for her; the man-cook had walked off the day before just at<br>dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given<br>warning.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p8" href="#p8" title="Paragraph 8"></a>Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch<br>Oblonsky--Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world--<br>woke up at his usual hour, that is, at eight o'clock in the<br>morning, not in his wife's bedroom, but on the leather-covered<br>sofa in his study. He turned over his stout, well-cared-for<br>person on the springy sofa, as though he would sink into a long<br>sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side<br>and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up<br>on the sofa, and opened his eyes.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p9" href="#p9" title="Paragraph 9"></a>"Yes, yes, how was it now?" he thought, going over his dream.<br>"Now, how was it? To be sure! Alabin was giving a dinner at<br>Darmstadt; no, not Darmstadt, but something American. Yes, but<br>then, Darmstadt was in America. Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner<br>on glass tables, and the tables sang, Il mio tesoro--not Il mio<br>tesoro though, but something better, and there were some sort of<br>little decanters on the table, and they were women, too," he<br>remembered.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p10" href="#p10" title="Paragraph 10"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch's eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a<br>smile. "Yes, it was nice, very nice. There was a great deal<br>more that was delightful, only there's no putting it into words,<br>or even expressing it in one's thoughts awake." And noticing a<br>gleam of light peeping in beside one of the serge curtains, he<br>cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa, and felt<br>about with them for his slippers, a present on his last birthday,<br>worked for him by his wife on gold-colored morocco. And, as he<br>had done every day for the last nine years, he stretched out his<br>hand, without getting up, towards the place where his<br>dressing-gown always hung in his bedroom. And thereupon he<br>suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his wife's room,<br>but in his study, and why: the smile vanished from his face, he<br>knitted his brows.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p11" href="#p11" title="Paragraph 11"></a>"Ah, ah, ah! Oo!..." he muttered, recalling everything that had<br>happened. And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife<br>was present to his imagination, all the hopelessness of his<br>position, and worst of all, his own fault.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p12" href="#p12" title="Paragraph 12"></a>"Yes, she won't forgive me, and she can't forgive me. And the<br>most awful thing about it is that it's all my fault--all my<br>fault, though I'm not to blame. That's the point of the whole<br>situation," he reflected. "Oh, oh, oh!" he kept repeating in<br>despair, as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused<br>him by this quarrel.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p13" href="#p13" title="Paragraph 13"></a>Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming,<br>happy and good-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his<br>hand for his wife, he had not found his wife in the drawing-room,<br>to his surprise had not found her in the study either, and saw<br>her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed<br>everything in her hand.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p14" href="#p14" title="Paragraph 14"></a>She, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household<br>details, and limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting<br>perfectly still with the letter in her hand, looking at him with<br>an expression of horror, despair, and indignation.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p15" href="#p15" title="Paragraph 15"></a>"What's this? this?" she asked, pointing to the letter.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p16" href="#p16" title="Paragraph 16"></a>And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the<br>case, was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in<br>which he had met his wife's words.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p17" href="#p17" title="Paragraph 17"></a>There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people<br>when they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful.<br>He did not succeed in adapting his face to the position in which<br>he was placed towards his wife by the discovery of his fault.<br>Instead of being hurt, denying, defending himself, begging<br>forgiveness, instead of remaining indifferent even--anything<br>would have been better than what he did do--his face utterly<br>involuntarily (reflex spinal action, reflected Stepan<br>Arkadyevitch, who was fond of physiology)--utterly involuntarily<br>assumed its habitual, good-humored, and therefore idiotic smile.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p18" href="#p18" title="Paragraph 18"></a>This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself. Catching sight<br>of that smile, Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke<br>out with her characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, and<br>rushed out of the room. Since then she had refused to see her<br>husband.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p19" href="#p19" title="Paragraph 19"></a>"It's that idiotic smile that's to blame for it all," thought<br>Stepan Arkadyevitch.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p20" href="#p20" title="Paragraph 20"></a>"But what's to be done? What's to be done?" he said to himself<br>in despair, and found no answer.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p21" href="#p21" title="Paragraph 21"></a>Chapter 2</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p22" href="#p22" title="Paragraph 22"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with<br>himself. He was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading<br>himself that he repented of his conduct. He could not at this<br>date repent of the fact that he, a handsome, susceptible man of<br>thirty-four, was not in love with his wife, the mother of five<br>living and two dead children, and only a year younger than<br>himself. All he repented of was that he had not succeeded better<br>in hiding it from his wife. But he felt all the difficulty of<br>his position and was sorry for his wife, his children, and<br>himself. Possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins<br>better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of<br>them would have had such an effect on her. He had never clearly<br>thought out the subject, but he had vaguely conceived that his<br>wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her,<br>and shut her eyes to the fact. He had even supposed that she, a<br>worn-out woman no longer young or good-looking, and in no way<br>remarkable or interesting, merely a good mother, ought from a<br>sense of fairness to take an indulgent view. It had turned out<br>quite the other way.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p23" href="#p23" title="Paragraph 23"></a>"Oh, it's awful! oh dear, oh dear! awful!" Stepan Arkadyevitch<br>kept repeating to himself, and he could think of nothing to be<br>done. "And how well things were going up till now! how well we<br>got on! She was contented and happy in her children; I never<br>interfered with her in anything; I let her manage the children<br>and the house just as she liked. It's true it's bad HER having<br>been a governess in our house. That's bad! There's something<br>common, vulgar, in flirting with one's governess. But what a<br>governess!" (He vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of Mlle.<br>Roland and her smile.) "But after all, while she was in the<br>house, I kept myself in hand. And the worst of it all is that<br>she's already...it seems as if ill-luck would have it so! Oh,<br>oh! But what, what is to be done?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p24" href="#p24" title="Paragraph 24"></a>There was no solution, but that universal solution which life<br>gives to all questions, even the most complex and insoluble.<br>That answer is: one must live in the needs of the day--that is,<br>forget oneself. To forget himself in sleep was impossible now,<br>at least till nighttime; he could not go back now to the music<br>sung by the decanter-women; so he must forget himself in the<br>dream of daily life.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p25" href="#p25" title="Paragraph 25"></a>"Then we shall see," Stepan Arkadyevitch said to himself, and<br>getting up he put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk,<br>tied the tassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air<br>into his broad, bare chest, he walked to the window with his<br>usual confident step, turning out his feet that carried his full<br>frame so easily. He pulled up the blind and rang the bell<br>loudly. It was at once answered by the appearance of an old<br>friend, his valet, Matvey, carrying his clothes, his boots, and a<br>telegram. Matvey was followed by the barber with all the<br>necessaries for shaving.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p26" href="#p26" title="Paragraph 26"></a>"Are there any papers form the office?" asked Stepan<br>Arkadyevitch, taking the telegram and seating himself at the<br>looking-glass.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p27" href="#p27" title="Paragraph 27"></a>"On the table," replied Matvey, glancing with inquiring sympathy<br>at his master; and, after a short pause, he added with a sly<br>smile, "They've sent from the carriage-jobbers."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p28" href="#p28" title="Paragraph 28"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch made no reply, he merely glanced at Matvey in<br>the looking-glass. In the glance, in which their eyes met in the<br>looking-glass, it was clear that they understood one another.<br>Stepan Arkadyevitch's eyes asked: "Why do you tell me that?<br>don't you know?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p29" href="#p29" title="Paragraph 29"></a>Matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets, thrust out one leg,<br>and gazed silently, good-humoredly, with a faint smile, at his<br>master.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p30" href="#p30" title="Paragraph 30"></a>"I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you<br>or themselves for nothing," he said. He had obviously prepared<br>the sentence beforehand.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p31" href="#p31" title="Paragraph 31"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract<br>attention to himself. Tearing open the telegram, he read it<br>through, guessing at the words, misspelt as they always are in<br>telegrams, and his face brightened.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p32" href="#p32" title="Paragraph 32"></a>"Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow," he<br>said, checking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber,<br>cutting a pink path through his long, curly whiskers.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p33" href="#p33" title="Paragraph 33"></a>"Thank God!" said Matvey, showing by this response that he, like<br>his master, realized the significance of this arrival--that is,<br>that Anna Arkadyevna, the sister he was so fond of, might bring<br>about a reconciliation between husband and wife.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p34" href="#p34" title="Paragraph 34"></a>"Alone, or with her husband?" inquired Matvey.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p35" href="#p35" title="Paragraph 35"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch could not answer, as the barber was at work<br>on his upper lip, and he raised one finger. Matvey nodded at the<br>looking-glass.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p36" href="#p36" title="Paragraph 36"></a>"Alone. Is the room to be got ready upstairs?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p37" href="#p37" title="Paragraph 37"></a>"Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p38" href="#p38" title="Paragraph 38"></a>"Darya Alexandrovna?" Matvey repeated, as though in doubt.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p39" href="#p39" title="Paragraph 39"></a>"Yes, inform her. Here, take the telegram; give it to her, and<br>then do what she tells you."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p40" href="#p40" title="Paragraph 40"></a>"You want to try it on," Matvey understood, but he only said,<br>"Yes sir."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p41" href="#p41" title="Paragraph 41"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be<br>dressed, when Matvey, stepping deliberately in his creaky boots,<br>came back into the room with the telegram in his hand. The<br>barber<br>had gone.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p42" href="#p42" title="Paragraph 42"></a>"Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away.<br>Let him do--that is you--as he likes," he said, laughing only<br>with his eyes, and putting his hands in his pockets, he watched<br>his master with his head on one side. Stepan Arkadyevitch was<br>silent a minute. Then a good-humored and rather pitiful smile<br>showed itself on his handsome face.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p43" href="#p43" title="Paragraph 43"></a>"Eh, Matvey?" he said, shaking his head.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p44" href="#p44" title="Paragraph 44"></a>"It's all right, sir; she will come round," said Matvey.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p45" href="#p45" title="Paragraph 45"></a>"Come round?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p46" href="#p46" title="Paragraph 46"></a>"Yes, sir."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p47" href="#p47" title="Paragraph 47"></a>"Do you think so? Who's there?" asked Stepan Arkadyevitch,<br>hearing the rustle of a woman's dress at the door.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p48" href="#p48" title="Paragraph 48"></a>"It's I," said a firm, pleasant, woman's voice, and the stern,<br>pockmarked face of Matrona Philimonovna, the nurse, was thrust<br>in at the doorway.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p49" href="#p49" title="Paragraph 49"></a>"Well, what is it, Matrona?" queried Stepan Arkadyevitch, going<br>up to her at the door.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p50" href="#p50" title="Paragraph 50"></a>Although Stepan Arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as<br>regards his wife, and was conscious of this himself, almost every<br>one in the house (even the nurse, Darya Alexandrovna's chief<br>ally) was on his side.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p51" href="#p51" title="Paragraph 51"></a>"Well, what now?" he asked disconsolately.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p52" href="#p52" title="Paragraph 52"></a>"Go to her, sir; own your fault again. Maybe God will aid you.<br>She is suffering so, it's sad to hee her; and besides, everything<br>in the house is topsy-turvy. You must have pity, sir, on the<br>children. Beg her forgiveness, sir. There's no help for it! One<br>must take the consequences..."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p53" href="#p53" title="Paragraph 53"></a>"But she won't see me."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p54" href="#p54" title="Paragraph 54"></a>"You do your part. God is merciful; pray to God, sir, pray to<br>God."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p55" href="#p55" title="Paragraph 55"></a>"Come, that'll do, you can go," said Stepan Arkadyevitch,<br>blushing suddenly. "Well now, do dress me." He turned to Matvey<br>and threw off his dressing-gown decisively.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p56" href="#p56" title="Paragraph 56"></a>Matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse's collar,<br>and, blowing off some invisible speck, he slipped it with obvious<br>pleasure over the well-groomed body of his master.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p57" href="#p57" title="Paragraph 57"></a>Chapter 3</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p58" href="#p58" title="Paragraph 58"></a>When he was dressed, Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on<br>himself, pulled down his shirt-cuffs, distributed into his<br>pockets his cigarettes, pocketbook, matches, and watch with its<br>double chain and seals, and shaking out his handkerchief, feeling<br>himself clean, fragrant, healthy, and physically at ease, in<br>spite of his unhappiness, he walked with a slight swing on each<br>leg into the dining-room, where coffee was already waiting for<br>him, and beside the coffee, letters and papers from the office.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p59" href="#p59" title="Paragraph 59"></a>He read the letters. One was very unpleasant, from a merchant<br>who was buying a forest on his wife's property. To sell this<br>forest was absolutely essential; but at present, until he was<br>reconciled with his wife, the subject could not be discussed.<br>The most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests<br>should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation<br>with his wife. And the idea that he might be let on by his<br>interests, that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on<br>account of the sale of the forest--that idea hurt him.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p60" href="#p60" title="Paragraph 60"></a>When he had finished his letters, Stepan Arkadyevitch moved the<br>office-papers close to him, rapidly looked through two pieces of<br>business, made a few notes with a big pencil, and pushing away<br>the papers, turned to his coffee. As he sipped his coffee, he<br>opened a still damp morning paper, and began reading it.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p61" href="#p61" title="Paragraph 61"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper, not an<br>extreme one, but one advocating the views held by the majority.<br>And in spite of the fact that science, art, and politics had no<br>special interest for him, he firmly held those views on all these<br>subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper, and he<br>only changed them when the majority changed them--or, more<br>strictly speaking, he did not change them, but they imperceptibly<br>changed of themselves within him.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p62" href="#p62" title="Paragraph 62"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his<br>views; these political opinions and views had come to him of<br>themselves, just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and<br>coat, but simply took those that were being worn. And for him,<br>living in a certain society--owing to the need, ordinarily<br>developed at years of discretion, for some degree of mental<br>activity--to have views was just as indispensable as to have a<br>hat. If there was a reason for his preferring liberal to<br>conservative views, which were held also by many of his circle,<br>it arose not from his considering liberalism more rational, but<br>from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life. The<br>liberal party said that in Russia everything is wrong, and<br>certainly Stepan Arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly<br>short of money. The liberal party said that marriage is an<br>institution quite out of date, and that it needs reconstruction;<br>and family life certainly afforded Stepan Arkadyevitch little<br>gratification, and forced him into lying and hypocrisy, which was<br>so repulsive to his nature. The liberal party said, or rather<br>allowed it to be understood, that religion is only a curb to keep<br>in check the barbarous classes of the people; and Stepan<br>Arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without<br>his legs aching from standing up, and could never make out what<br>was the object of all the terrible and high-flown language about<br>another world when life might be so very amusing in this world.<br>And with all this, Stepan Arkadyevitch, who liked a joke, was<br>fond of puzzling a plain man by saying that if he prided himself<br>on his origin, he ought not to stop at Rurik and disown the first<br>founder of his family--the monkey. And so Liberalism had become<br>a habit of Stepan Arkadyevitch's, and he liked his newspaper, as<br>he did his cigar after dinner, for the slight fog it diffused in<br>his brain. He read the leading article, in which it was<br>maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an<br>outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all<br>conservative elements, and that the government ought to take<br>measures to crush the revolutionary hydra; that, on the contrary,<br>"in our opinion the danger lies not in that fantastic<br>revolutionary hydra, but in the obstinacy of traditionalism<br>clogging progress," etc., etc. He read another article, too, a<br>financial one, which alluded to Bentham and Mill, and dropped<br>some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry. With his<br>characteristic quickwittedness he caught the drift of each<br>innuendo, divined whence it came, at whom and on what ground it<br>was aimed, and that afforded him, as it always did, a certain<br>satisfaction. But today that satisfaction was embittered by<br>Matrona Philimonovna's advice and the unsatisfactory state of the<br>household. He read, too, that Count Beist was rumored to have<br>left for Wiesbaden, and that one need have no more gray hair, and<br>of the sale of a light carriage, and of a young person seeking a<br>situation; but these items of information did not give him, as<br>usual, a quiet, ironical gratification. Having finished the<br>paper, a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter, he got up,<br>shaking the crumbs of the roll off his waistcoat; and, squaring<br>his broad chest, he smiled joyously: not because there was<br>anything particularly agreeable in his mind--the joyous smile<br>was evoked by a good digestion.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p63" href="#p63" title="Paragraph 63"></a>But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to<br>him, and he grew thoughtful.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p64" href="#p64" title="Paragraph 64"></a>Two childish voices (Stepan Arkadyevitch recognized the voices of<br>Grisha, his youngest boy, and Tanya, his eldest girl) were heard<br>outside the door. They were carrying something, and dropped it.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p65" href="#p65" title="Paragraph 65"></a>"I told you not to sit passengers on the roof," said the little<br>girl in English; "there, pick them up!"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p66" href="#p66" title="Paragraph 66"></a>"Everything's in confusion," thought Stepan Arkadyevitch; "there<br>are the children running about by themselves." And going to the<br>door, he called them. They threw down the box, that represented<br>a train, and came in to their father.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p67" href="#p67" title="Paragraph 67"></a>The little girl, her father's favorite, ran up boldly, embraced<br>him, and hung laughingly on his neck, enjoying as she always did<br>the smell of scent that came from his whiskers. At last the<br>little girl kissed his face, which was flushed from his stooping<br>posture and beaming with tenderness, loosed her hands, and was<br>about to run away again; but her father held her back.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p68" href="#p68" title="Paragraph 68"></a>"How is mamma?" he asked, passing his hand over his daughter's<br>smooth, soft little neck. "Good morning," he said, smiling to<br>the boy, who had come up to greet him. He was conscious that he<br>loved the boy less, and always tried to be fair; but the boy felt<br>it, and did not respond with a smile to his father's chilly<br>smile.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p69" href="#p69" title="Paragraph 69"></a>"Mamma? She is up," answered the girl.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p70" href="#p70" title="Paragraph 70"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed. "That means that she's not slept<br>again all night," he thought.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p71" href="#p71" title="Paragraph 71"></a>"Well, is she cheerful?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p72" href="#p72" title="Paragraph 72"></a>The little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father<br>and mother, and that her mother could not be cheerful, and that<br>her father must be aware of this, and that he was pretending when<br>he asked about it so lightly. And she blushed for her father.<br>He at once perceived it, and blushed too.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p73" href="#p73" title="Paragraph 73"></a>"I don't know," she said. "She did not say we must do our<br>lessons, but she said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to<br>grandmamma's."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p74" href="#p74" title="Paragraph 74"></a>"Well, go, Tanya, my darling. Oh, wait a minute, though," he<br>said, still holding her and stroking her soft little hand.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p75" href="#p75" title="Paragraph 75"></a>He took off the mantelpiece, where he had put it yesterday, a<br>little box of sweets, and gave her two, picking out her<br>favorites, a chocolate and a fondant.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p76" href="#p76" title="Paragraph 76"></a>"For Grisha?" said the little girl, pointing to the chocolate.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p77" href="#p77" title="Paragraph 77"></a>"Yes, yes." And still stroking her little shoulder, he kissed<br>her on the roots of here hair and neck, and let her go.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p78" href="#p78" title="Paragraph 78"></a>"The carriage is ready," said Matvey; "but there's some one to<br>see you with a petition."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p79" href="#p79" title="Paragraph 79"></a>"Been here long?" asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p80" href="#p80" title="Paragraph 80"></a>"Half an hour."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p81" href="#p81" title="Paragraph 81"></a>"How many times have I told you to tell me at once?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p82" href="#p82" title="Paragraph 82"></a>"One must let you drink your coffee in peace, at least," said<br>Matvey, in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was<br>impossible to be angry.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p83" href="#p83" title="Paragraph 83"></a>"Well, show the person up at once," said Oblonsky, frowning with<br>vexation.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p84" href="#p84" title="Paragraph 84"></a>The petitioner, the widow of a staff captain Kalinin, came with a<br>request impossible and unreasonable; but Stepan Arkadyevitch, as<br>he generally did, made her sit down, heard her to the end<br>attentively without interrupting her, and gave her detailed<br>advice as to how and to whom to apply, and even wrote her, in his<br>large, sprawling, good and legible hand, a confident and fluent<br>little note to a personage who might be of use to her. Having<br>got rid of the staff captain's widow, Stepan Arkadyevitch took<br>his hat and stopped to recollect whether he had forgotten<br>anything. It appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what<br>he wanted to forget--his wife.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p85" href="#p85" title="Paragraph 85"></a>"Ah, yes!" He bowed his head, and his handsome face assumed a<br>harassed expression. "To go, or not to go!" he said to himself;<br>and an inner voice told him he must not go, that nothing could<br>come of it but falsity; that to amend, to set right their<br>relations was impossible, because it was impossible to make her<br>attractive again and able to inspire love, or to make him an old<br>man, not susceptible to love. Except deceit and lying nothing<br>could come of it now; and deceit and lying were opposed to his<br>nature.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p86" href="#p86" title="Paragraph 86"></a>"It must be some time, though: it can't go on like this," he<br>said, trying to give himself courage. He squared his chest, took<br>out a cigarette, took two whiffs at it, flung it into a<br>mother-of-pearl ashtray, and with rapid steps walked through the<br>drawing room, and opened the other door into his wife's bedroom.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p87" href="#p87" title="Paragraph 87"></a>Chapter 4</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p88" href="#p88" title="Paragraph 88"></a>Darya Alexandrovna, in a dressing jacket, and with her now<br>scanty, once luxuriant and beautiful hair fastened up with<br>hairpins on the nape of her neck, with a sunken, thin face and<br>large, startled eyes, which looked prominent from the thinness of<br>her face, was standing among a litter of all sorts of things<br>scattered all over the room, before an open bureau, from which<br>she was taking something. Hearing her husband's steps, she<br>stopped, looking towards the door, and trying assiduously to give<br>her features a severe and contemptuous expression. She felt she<br>was afraid of him, and afraid of the coming interview. She was<br>just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times<br>already in these last three days--to sort out the children's<br>things and her own, so as to take them to her mother's--and<br>again she could not bring herself to do this; but now again, as<br>each time before, she kept saying to herself, "that things cannot<br>go on like this, that she must take some step" to punish him, put<br>him to shame, avenge on him some little part at least of the<br>suffering he had caused her. She still continued to tell<br>herself that she should leave him, but she was conscious that<br>this was impossible; it was impossible because she could not get<br>out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and loving him.<br>Besides this, she realized that if even here in her own house she<br>could hardly manage to look after her five children properly,<br>they would be still worse off where she was going with them all.<br>As it was, even in the course of these three days, the youngest<br>was unwell from being given unwholesome soup, and the others had<br>almost gone without their dinner the day before. She was<br>conscious that it was impossible to go away; but, cheating<br>herself, she went on all the same sorting out her things and<br>pretending she was going.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p89" href="#p89" title="Paragraph 89"></a>Seeing her husband, she dropped her hands into the drawer of the<br>bureau as though looking for something, and only looked round at<br>him when he had come quite up to her. But her face, to which she<br>tried to give a severe and resolute expression, betrayed<br>bewilderment and suffering.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p90" href="#p90" title="Paragraph 90"></a>"Dolly!" he said in a subdued and timid voice. He bent his head<br>towards his shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble, but<br>for all that he was radiant with freshness and health. In a<br>rapid glance she scanned his figure that beamed with health and<br>freshness. "Yes, he is happy and content!" she thought; "while<br>I.... And that disgusting good nature, which every one likes him<br>for and praises--I hate that good nature of his," she thought.<br>Her mouth stiffened, the muscles of the cheek contracted on the<br>right side of her pale, nervous face.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p91" href="#p91" title="Paragraph 91"></a>"What do you want?" she said in a rapid, deep, unnatural voice.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p92" href="#p92" title="Paragraph 92"></a>"Dolly!" he repeated, with a quiver in his voice. "Anna is<br>coming today."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p93" href="#p93" title="Paragraph 93"></a>"Well, what is that to me? I can't see her!" she cried.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p94" href="#p94" title="Paragraph 94"></a>"But you must, really, Dolly..."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p95" href="#p95" title="Paragraph 95"></a>"Go away, go away, go away!" she shrieked, not looking at him, as<br>though this shriek were called up by physical pain.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p96" href="#p96" title="Paragraph 96"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife, he<br>could hope that she would come round, as Matvey expressed it, and<br>could quietly go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee;<br>but when he saw her tortured, suffering face, heard the tone of<br>her voice, submissive to fate and full of despair, there was a<br>catch in his breath and a lump in his throat, and his eyes began<br>to shine with tears.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p97" href="#p97" title="Paragraph 97"></a>"My God! what have I done? Dolly! For God's sake!.... You<br>know...." He could not go on; there was a sob in his throat.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p98" href="#p98" title="Paragraph 98"></a>She shut the bureau with a slam, and glanced at him.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p99" href="#p99" title="Paragraph 99"></a>"Dolly, what can I say?.... One thing: forgive...Remember,<br>cannot nine years of my life atone for an instant...."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p100" href="#p100" title="Paragraph 100"></a>She dropped her eyes and listened, expecting what he would say,<br>as it were beseeching him in some way or other to make her<br>believe differently.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p101" href="#p101" title="Paragraph 101"></a>"--instant of passion?" he said, and would have gone on, but at<br>that word, as at a pang of physical pain, her lips stiffened<br>again, and again the muscles of her right cheek worked.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p102" href="#p102" title="Paragraph 102"></a>"Go away, go out of the room!" she shrieked still more shrilly,<br>"and don't talk to me of your passion and your loathsomeness."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p103" href="#p103" title="Paragraph 103"></a>She tried to go out, but tottered, and clung to the back of a<br>chair to support herself. His face relaxed, his lips swelled,<br>his eyes were swimming with tears.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p104" href="#p104" title="Paragraph 104"></a>"Dolly!" he said, sobbing now; "for mercy's sake, think of the<br>children; they are not to blame! I am to blame, and punish me,<br>make me expiate my fault. Anything I can do, I am ready to do<br>anything! I am to blame, no words can express how much I am to<br>blame! But, Dolly, forgive me!"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p105" href="#p105" title="Paragraph 105"></a>She sat down. He listened to her hard, heavy breathing, and he<br>was unutterably sorry for her. She tried several times to begin<br>to speak, but could not. He waited.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p106" href="#p106" title="Paragraph 106"></a>"You remember the children, Stiva, to play with them; but I<br>remember them, and know that this means their ruin," she<br>said--obviously one of the phrases she had more than once<br>repeated to herself in the course of the last few days.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p107" href="#p107" title="Paragraph 107"></a>She had called him "Stiva," and he glanced at her with gratitude,<br>and moved to take her hand, but she drew back from him with<br>aversion.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p108" href="#p108" title="Paragraph 108"></a>"I think of the children, and for that reason I would do anything<br>in the world to save them, but I don't myself know how to save<br>them. By taking them away from their father, or by leaving them<br>with a vicious father--yes, a vicious father.... Tell me, after<br>what...has happened, can we live together? Is that possible?<br>Tell me, eh, is it possible?" she repeated, raising her voice,<br>"after my husband, the father of my children, enters into a<br>love affair with his own children's governess?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p109" href="#p109" title="Paragraph 109"></a>"But what could I do? what could I do?" he kept saying in a<br>pitiful voice, not knowing what he was saying, as his head sank<br>lower and lower.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p110" href="#p110" title="Paragraph 110"></a>"You are loathsome to me, repulsive!" she shrieked, getting more<br>and more heated. "Your tears mean nothing! You have never loved<br>me; you have neither heart nor honorable feeling! You are<br>hateful to me, disgusting, a stranger--yes, a complete<br>stranger!" With pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible<br>to herself--stranger.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p111" href="#p111" title="Paragraph 111"></a>He looked at her, and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and<br>amazed him.

And how vulgarly she shouted," he said to<br>himself, remembering her shriek and the words--"scoundrel" and<br>"mistress." "And very likely the maids were listening! Horribly<br>vulgar! horrible!" Stepan Arkadyevitch stood a few seconds<br>alone, wiped his face, squared his chest, and walked out of the<br>room.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p120" href="#p120" title="Paragraph 120"></a>It was Friday, and in the dining room the German watchmaker was<br>winding up the clock.

Stepan Arkadyevitch was fond of a joke: "And maybe she<br>will come round! That's a good expression, 'come round,'" he<br>thought. "I must repeat that."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p121" href="#p121" title="Paragraph 121"></a>"Matvey!" he shouted.

It was her solitary refuge from the<br>household cares which crowded upon her directly she went out from<br>it. Even now, in the short time she had been in the nursery, the<br>English governess and Matrona Philimonovna had succeeded in<br>putting several questions to her, which did not admit of delay,<br>and which only she could answer: "What were the children to put<br>on for their walk? Should they have any milk? Should not a new<br>cook be sent for?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p128" href="#p128" title="Paragraph 128"></a>"Ah, let me alone, let me alone!" she said, and going back to her<br>bedroom she sat down in the same place as she had sat when<br>talking to her husband, clasping tightly her thin hands with the<br>rings that slipped down on her bony fingers, and fell to going<br>over in her memory all the conversation. "He has gone! But has<br>he broken it off with her?" she thought. "Can it be he sees her?<br>Why didn't I ask him! No, no, reconciliation is impossible.<br>Even if we remain in the same house, we are strangers--strangers<br>forever!" She repeated again with special significance the word<br>so dreadful to her. "And how I loved him! my God, how I loved<br>him!.... How I loved him! And now don't I love him? Don't I<br>love him more than before? The most horrible thing is," she<br>began, but did not finish her thought, because Matrona<br>Philimonovna put her head in at the door.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p129" href="#p129" title="Paragraph 129"></a>"Let us send for my brother," she said; "he can get a dinner<br>anyway, or we shall have the children getting nothing to eat till<br>six again, like yesterday."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p130" href="#p130" title="Paragraph 130"></a>"Very well, I will come directly and see about it.

But in spite of<br>his habitually dissipated mode of life, his inferior grade in the<br>service, and his comparative youth, he occupied the honorable and<br>lucrative position of president of one of the government boards<br>at Moscow. This post he had received through his sister Anna's<br>husband, Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin, who held one of the most<br>important positions in the ministry to whose department the<br>Moscow office belonged. But if Karenin had not got his brother-<br>in-law this berth, then through a hundred other personages--<br>brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, and aunts--Stiva Oblonsky<br>would have received this post, or some other similar one,<br>together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for<br>them, as his affairs, in spite of his wife's considerable<br>property, were in an embarrassed condition.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p134" href="#p134" title="Paragraph 134"></a>Half Moscow and Petersburg were friends and relations of Stepan<br>Arkadyevitch. He was born in the midst of those who had been and<br>are the powerful ones of this world. One-third of the men in the<br>government, the older men, had been friends of his father's, and<br>had known him in petticoats; another third were his intimate<br>chums, and the remainder were friendly acquaintances.<br>Consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape<br>of places, rents, shares, and such, were all his friends, and<br>could not overlook one of their own set; and Oblonsky had no need<br>to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post. He had<br>only not to refuse things, not to show jealousy, not to be<br>quarrelsome or take offense, all of which from his<br>characteristic good nature he never did. It would have struck<br>him as absurd if he had been told that he would not get a<br>position with the salary he required, especially as he expected<br>nothing out of the way; he only wanted what the men of his own<br>age and standing did get, and he was no worse qualified for<br>performing duties of the kind than any other man.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p135" href="#p135" title="Paragraph 135"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him for<br>his good humor, but for his bright disposition, and his<br>unquestionable honesty. In him, in his handsome, radiant figure,<br>his sparkling eyes, black hair and eyebrows, and the white and<br>red of his face, there was something which produced a physical<br>effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him.<br>"Aha! Stiva! Oblonsky! Here he is!" was almost always said<br>with a smile of delight on meeting him. Even though it happened<br>at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that<br>nothing particularly delightful had happened, the next day, and<br>the next, every one was just as delighted at meeting him again.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p136" href="#p136" title="Paragraph 136"></a>After filling for three years the post of president of one of the<br>government boards at Moscow, Stepan Arkadyevitch had won the<br>respect, as well as the liking, of his fellow officials,<br>subordinates, and superiors, and all who had had business with<br>him. The principal qualities in Stepan Arkadyevitch which had<br>gained him this universal respect in the service consisted, in<br>the first place, of his extreme indulgence for others, founded on<br>a consciousness of his own shortcomings; secondly, of his perfect<br>liberalism--not the liberalism he read of in the papers, but the<br>liberalism that was in his blood, in virtue of which he treated<br>all men perfectly equally and exactly the same, whatever their<br>fortune or calling might be; and thirdly--the most important<br>point--his complete indifference to the business in which he was<br>engaged, in consequence of which he was never carried away, and<br>never made mistakes.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p137" href="#p137" title="Paragraph 137"></a>On reaching the offices of the board, Stepan Arkadyevitch,<br>escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio, went into his<br>little private room, put on his uniform, and went into the<br>boardroom. The clerks and copyists all rose, greeting him with<br>good-humored deference. Stepan Arkadyevitch moved quickly, as<br>ever, to his place, shook hands with his colleagues, and sat<br>down. He made a joke or two, and talked just as much as was<br>consistent with due decorum, and began work. No one knew better<br>than Stepan Arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between<br>freedom, simplicity, and official stiffness necessary for the<br>agreeable conduct of business. A secretary, with the<br>good-humored deference common to every one in Stepan<br>Arkadyevitch's office, came up with papers, and began to speak in<br>the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by Stepan<br>Arkadyevitch.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p138" href="#p138" title="Paragraph 138"></a>"We have succeeded in getting the information from the government<br>department of Penza.

"Now, gentlemen...."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p140" href="#p140" title="Paragraph 140"></a>And the sitting of the board began.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p141" href="#p141" title="Paragraph 141"></a>"If they knew," he thought, bending his head with a significant<br>air as he listened to the report, "what a guilty little boy their<br>president was half an hour ago." And his eyes were laughing<br>during the reading of the report. Till two o'clock the sitting<br>would go on without a break, and at two o'clock there would be an<br>interval and luncheon.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p142" href="#p142" title="Paragraph 142"></a>It was not yet two, when the large glass doors of the boardroom<br>suddenly opened and someone came in.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p143" href="#p143" title="Paragraph 143"></a>All the officials sitting on the further side under the portrait<br>of the Tsar and the eagle, delighted at any distraction, looked<br>round at the door; but the doorkeeper standing at the door at<br>once drove out the intruder, and closed the glass door after him.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p144" href="#p144" title="Paragraph 144"></a>When the case had been read through, Stepan Arkadyevitch got up<br>and stretched, and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the<br>times took out a cigarette in the boardroom and went into his<br>private room. Two of the members of the board, the old veteran<br>in the service, Nikitin, and the Kammerjunker Grinevitch, went in<br>with him.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p145" href="#p145" title="Paragraph 145"></a>"We shall have time to finish after lunch," said Stepan<br>Arkadyevitch.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p146" href="#p146" title="Paragraph 146"></a>"To be sure we shall!" said Nikitin.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p147" href="#p147" title="Paragraph 147"></a>"A pretty sharp fellow this Fomin must be," said Grinevitch of<br>one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p148" href="#p148" title="Paragraph 148"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned at Grinevitch's words, giving him<br>thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment<br>prematurely, and made him no reply.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p149" href="#p149" title="Paragraph 149"></a>"Who was that came in?" he asked the doorkeeper.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p150" href="#p150" title="Paragraph 150"></a>"Someone, your excellency, crept in without permission directly<br>my back was turned.

One of the members going down--a<br>lean official with a portfolio--stood out of his way and looked<br>disapprovingly at the legs of the stranger, then glanced<br>inquiringly at Oblonsky.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p153" href="#p153" title="Paragraph 153"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch was standing at the top of the stairs. His<br>good-naturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his<br>uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming<br>up.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p154" href="#p154" title="Paragraph 154"></a>"Why, it's actually you, Levin, at last!" he said with a friendly<br>mocking smile, scanning Levin as he approached. "How is it you<br>have deigned to look me up in this den?" said Stepan<br>Arkadyevitch, and not content with shaking hands, he kissed his<br>friend. "Have you been here long?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p155" href="#p155" title="Paragraph 155"></a>"I have just come, and very much wanted to see you," said Levin,<br>looking shyly and at the same time angry and uneasily around.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p156" href="#p156" title="Paragraph 156"></a>"Well, let's go into my room," said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who knew<br>his friend's sensitive and irritable shyness, and, taking his<br>arm, he drew him along, as though guiding him through dangers.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p157" href="#p157" title="Paragraph 157"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his<br>acquaintances, and called almost all of them by their Christian<br>names: old men of sixty, boys of twenty, actors, ministers,<br>merchants, and adjutant-generals, so that many of his intimate<br>chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder,<br>and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had,<br>through the medium of Oblonsky, something in common. He was the<br>familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of<br>champagne, and he took a glass of champagne with everyone, and<br>when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums, as he<br>used in joke to call many of his friends, in the presence of his<br>subordinates, he well knew how, with his characteristic tact, to<br>diminish the disagreeable impression made on them. Levin was<br>not a disreputable chum, but Oblonsky, with his ready tact, felt<br>that Levin fancied he might not care to show his intimacy with<br>him before his subordinates, and so he made haste to take him off<br>into his room.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p158" href="#p158" title="Paragraph 158"></a>Levin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky; their intimacy did<br>not rest merely on champagne. Levin had been the friend and<br>companion of his early youth. They were fond of one another in<br>spite of the difference of their characters and tastes, as<br>friends are fond of one another who have been together in early<br>youth. But in spite of this, each of them--as is often the way<br>with men who have selected careers of different kinds--though in<br>discussion he would even justify the other's career, in his heart<br>despised it. It seemed to each of them that the life he led<br>himself was the only real life, and the life led by his friend<br>was a mere phantasm. Oblonsky could not restrain a slight<br>mocking smile at the sight of Levin. How often he had seen him<br>come up to Moscow from the country where he was doing something,<br>but what precisely Stepan Arkadyevitch could never quite make<br>out, and indeed he took no interest in the matter. Levin arrived<br>in Moscow always excited and in a hurry, rather ill at ease and<br>irritated by his own want of ease, and for the most part with a<br>perfectly new, unexpected view of things. Stepan Arkadyevitch<br>laughed at this, and liked it. In the same way Levin in his<br>heart despised the town mode of life of his friend, and his<br>official duties, which he laughed at, and regarded as trifling.<br>But the difference was that Oblonsky, as he was doing the same as<br>every one did, laughed complacently and good-humoredly, while<br>Levin laughed without complacency and sometimes angrily.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p159" href="#p159" title="Paragraph 159"></a>"We have long been expecting you," said Stepan Arkadyevitch,<br>going into his room and letting Levin's hand go as though to show<br>that here all danger was over. "I am very, very glad to see<br>you," he went on. "Well, how are you? Eh? When did you come?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p160" href="#p160" title="Paragraph 160"></a>Levin was silent, looking at the unknown faces of Oblonsky's two<br>companions, and especially at the hand of the elegant Grinevitch,<br>which had such long white fingers, such long yellow<br>filbert-shaped nails, and such huge shining studs on the<br>shirt-cuff, that apparently they absorbed all his attention, and<br>allowed him no freedom of thought. Oblonsky noticed this at<br>once, and smiled.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p161" href="#p161" title="Paragraph 161"></a>"Ah, to be sure, let me introduce you," he said. "My colleagues:<br>Philip Ivanitch Nikitin, Mihail Stanislavitch Grinevitch"--and<br>turning to Levin--"a district councilor, a modern district<br>councilman, a gymnast who lifts thirteen stone with one hand, a<br>cattle-breeder and sportsman, and my friend, Konstantin<br>Dmitrievitch Levin, the brother of Sergey Ivonovitch Koznishev."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p162" href="#p162" title="Paragraph 162"></a>"Delighted," said the veteran.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p163" href="#p163" title="Paragraph 163"></a>"I have the honor of knowing your brother, Sergey Ivanovitch,"<br>said Grinevitch, holding out his slender hand with its long<br>nails.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p164" href="#p164" title="Paragraph 164"></a>Levin frowned, shook hands coldly, and at once turned to<br>Oblonsky. Though he had a great respect for his half-brother, an<br>author well known to all Russia, he could not endure it when<br>people treated him not as Konstantin Levin, but as the brother of<br>the celebrated Koznishev.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p165" href="#p165" title="Paragraph 165"></a>"No, I am no longer a district councilor. I have quarreled with<br>them all, and don't go to the meetings any more," he said,<br>turning to Oblonsky.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p166" href="#p166" title="Paragraph 166"></a>"You've been quick about it!" said Oblonsky with a smile. "But<br>how? why?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p167" href="#p167" title="Paragraph 167"></a>"It's a long story. I will tell you some time," said Levin, but<br>he began telling him at once. "Well, to put it shortly, I was<br>convinced that nothing was really done by the district councils,<br>or ever could be," he began, as though some one had just insulted<br>him. "On one side it's a plaything; they play at being a<br>parliament, and I'm neither young enough nor old enough to find<br>amusement in playthings; and on the other side" (he stammered)<br>"it's a means for the coterie of the district to make money.<br>Formerly they had wardships, courts of justice, now they have the<br>district council--not in the form of bribes, but in the form of<br>unearned salary," he said, as hotly as though someone of those<br>present had opposed his opinion.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p168" href="#p168" title="Paragraph 168"></a>"Aha! You're in a new phase again, I see--a conservative," said<br>Stepan Arkadyevitch. "However, we can go into that later."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p169" href="#p169" title="Paragraph 169"></a>"Yes, later. But I wanted to see you," said Levin, looking with<br>hatred at Grinevitch's hand.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p170" href="#p170" title="Paragraph 170"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p171" href="#p171" title="Paragraph 171"></a>"How was it you used to say you would never wear European dress<br>again?" he said, scanning his new suit, obviously cut by a French<br>tailor. "Ah! I see: a new phase."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p172" href="#p172" title="Paragraph 172"></a>Levin suddenly blushed, not as grown men blush, slightly, without<br>being themselves aware of it, but as boys blush, feeling that<br>they are ridiculous through their shyness, and consequently<br>ashamed of it and blushing still more, almost to the point of<br>tears. And it was so strange to see this sensible, manly face in<br>such a childish plight, that Oblonsky left off looking at him.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p173" href="#p173" title="Paragraph 173"></a>"Oh, where shall we meet? You know I want very much to talk to<br>you," said Levin.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p174" href="#p174" title="Paragraph 174"></a>Oblonsky seemed to ponder.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p175" href="#p175" title="Paragraph 175"></a>"I'll tell you what: let's go to Gurin's to lunch, and there we<br>can talk. I am free till three."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p176" href="#p176" title="Paragraph 176"></a>"No," answered Levin, after an instant's thought, "I have got to<br>go on somewhere else."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p177" href="#p177" title="Paragraph 177"></a>"All right, then, let's dine together."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p178" href="#p178" title="Paragraph 178"></a>"Dine together? But I have nothing very particular, only a few<br>words to say, and a question I want to ask you, and we can have a<br>talk afterwards."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p179" href="#p179" title="Paragraph 179"></a>"Well, say the few words, then, at once, and we'll gossip after<br>dinner."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p180" href="#p180" title="Paragraph 180"></a>"Well, it's this," said Levin; "but it's of no importance,<br>though."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p181" href="#p181" title="Paragraph 181"></a>His face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort<br>he was making to surmount his shyness.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p182" href="#p182" title="Paragraph 182"></a>"What are the Shtcherbatskys doing? Everything as it used to<br>be?" he said.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p183" href="#p183" title="Paragraph 183"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had long known that Levin was in love<br>with his sister-in-law, Kitty, gave a hardly perceptible smile,<br>and his eyes sparkled merrily.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p184" href="#p184" title="Paragraph 184"></a>"You said a few words, but I can't answer in a few words,<br>because.... Excuse me a minute..."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p185" href="#p185" title="Paragraph 185"></a>A secretary came in, with respectful familiarity and the modest<br>consciousness, characteristic of every secretary, of superiority<br>to his chief in the knowledge of their business; he went up to<br>Oblonsky with some papers, and began, under pretense of asking a<br>question, to explain some objection. Stepan Arkadyevitch,<br>without hearing him out, laid his hand genially on the<br>secretary's sleeve.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p186" href="#p186" title="Paragraph 186"></a>"No, you do as I told you," he said, softening his words with a<br>smile, and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he<br>turned away from the papers, and said: "So do it that way, if you<br>please, Zahar Nikititch."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p187" href="#p187" title="Paragraph 187"></a>The secretary retired in confusion. During the consultation with<br>the secretary Levin had completely recovered from his<br>embarrassment. He was standing with his elbows on the back of a<br>chair, and on his face was a look of ironical attention.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p188" href="#p188" title="Paragraph 188"></a>"I don't understand it, I don't understand it," he said.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p189" href="#p189" title="Paragraph 189"></a>"What don't you understand?" said Oblonsky, smiling as brightly<br>as ever, and picking up a cigarette. He expected some queer<br>outburst from Levin.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p190" href="#p190" title="Paragraph 190"></a>"I don't understand what you are doing," said Levin, shrugging<br>his shoulders. "How can you do it seriously?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p191" href="#p191" title="Paragraph 191"></a>"Why not?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p192" href="#p192" title="Paragraph 192"></a>"Why, because there's nothing in it."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p193" href="#p193" title="Paragraph 193"></a>"You think so, but we're overwhelmed with work."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p194" href="#p194" title="Paragraph 194"></a>"On paper. But, there, you've a gift for it," added Levin.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p195" href="#p195" title="Paragraph 195"></a>"That's to say, you think there's a lack of something in me?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p196" href="#p196" title="Paragraph 196"></a>"Perhaps so," said Levin. "But all the same I admire your<br>grandeur, and am proud that I've a friend in such a great person.<br>You've not answered my question, though," he went on, with a<br>desperate effort looking Oblonsky straight in the face.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p197" href="#p197" title="Paragraph 197"></a>"Oh, that's all very well. You wait a bit, and you'll come to<br>this yourself. It's very nice for you to have over six thousand<br>acres in the Karazinsky district, and such muscles, and the<br>freshness of a girl of twelve; still you'll be one of us one day.<br>Yes, as to your question, there is no change, but it's a pity<br>you've been away so long."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p198" href="#p198" title="Paragraph 198"></a>"Oh, why so?" Levin queried, panic-stricken.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p199" href="#p199" title="Paragraph 199"></a>"Oh, nothing," responded Oblonsky. "We'll talk it over. But<br>what's brought you up to town?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p200" href="#p200" title="Paragraph 200"></a>"Oh, we'll talk about that, too, later on," said Levin, reddening<br>again up to his ears.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p201" href="#p201" title="Paragraph 201"></a>"All right. I see," said Stepan Arkadyevitch. "I should ask you<br>to come to us, you know, but my wife's not quite the thing.

This intimacy had grown still closer during Levin's<br>student days. He had both prepared for the university with the<br>young Prince Shtcherbatsky, the brother of Kitty and Dolly, and<br>had entered at the same time with him. In those days Levin used<br>often to be in the Shtcherbatskys' house, and he was in love with<br>the Shtcherbatsky household. Strange as it may appear, it was<br>with the household, the family, that Konstantin Levin was in<br>love, especially with the feminine half of the household. Levin<br>did not remember his own mother, and his only sister was older<br>than he was, so that it was in the Shtcherbatskys' house that he<br>saw for the first time that inner life of an old, noble,<br>cultivated, and honorable family of which he had been deprived by<br>the death of his father and mother. All the members of that<br>family, especially the feminine half, were pictured by him, as<br>it were, wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil, and he<br>not only perceived no defects whatever in them, but under the<br>poetical veil that shrouded them he assumed the existence of the<br>loftiest sentiments and every possible perfection. Why it was<br>the three young ladies had one day to speak French, and the next<br>English; why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on<br>the piano, the sounds of which were audible in their brother's<br>room above, where the students used to work; why they were<br>visited by those professors of French literature, of music, of<br>drawing, of dancing; why at certain hours all the three young<br>ladies, with Mademoiselle Linon, drove in the coach to the<br>Tversky boulevard, dressed in their satin cloaks, Dolly in a long<br>one, Natalia in a half-long one, and Kitty in one so short that<br>her shapely legs in tightly-drawn red stockings were visible to<br>all beholders; why it was they had to walk about the Tversky<br>boulevard escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his<br>hat--all this and much more that was done in their mysterious<br>world he did not understand, but he was sure that everything that<br>was done there was very good, and he was in love precisely with<br>the mystery of the proceedings.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p213" href="#p213" title="Paragraph 213"></a>In his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest,<br>Dolly, but she was soon married to Oblonsky. Then he began being<br>in love with the second. He felt, as it were, that he had to be<br>in love with one of the sisters, only he could not quite make out<br>which. But Natalia, too, had hardly made her appearance in the<br>world when she married the diplomat Lvov. Kitty was still a<br>child when Levin left the university. Young Shtcherbatsky went<br>into the navy, was drowned in the Baltic, and Levin's relations<br>with the Shtcherbatskys, in spite of his friendship with<br>Oblonsky, became less intimate. But when early in the winter of<br>this year Levin came to Moscow, after a year in the country, and<br>saw the Shtcherbatskys, he realized which of the three sisters he<br>was indeed destined to love.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p214" href="#p214" title="Paragraph 214"></a>One would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for<br>him, a man of good family, rather rich than poor, and thirty-two<br>years old, to make the young Princess Shtcherbatskaya an offer of<br>marriage; in all likelihood he would at once have been looked<br>upon as a good match. But Levin was in love, and so it seemed to<br>him that Kitty was so perfect in every respect that she was a<br>creature far above everything earthly; and that he was a creature<br>so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that<br>other people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p215" href="#p215" title="Paragraph 215"></a>After spending two months in Moscow in a state of enchantment,<br>seeing Kitty almost every day in society, into which he went so<br>as to meet her, he abruptly decided that it could not be, and<br>went back to the country.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p216" href="#p216" title="Paragraph 216"></a>Levin's conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea<br>that in the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and<br>worthless match for the charming Kitty, and that Kitty herself<br>could not love him. In her family's eyes he had no ordinary,<br>definite career and position in society, while his contemporaries<br>by this time, when he was thirty-two, were already, one a<br>colonel, and another a professor, another director of a bank and<br>railways, or president of a board like Oblonsky. But he (he knew<br>very well how he must appear to others) was a country gentleman,<br>occupied in breeding cattle, shooting game, and building barns;<br>in other words, a fellow of no ability, who had not turned out<br>well, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of the<br>world, is done by people fit for nothing else.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p217" href="#p217" title="Paragraph 217"></a>The mysterious, enchanting Kitty herself could not love such an<br>ugly person as he conceived himself to be, and, above all, such<br>an ordinary, in no way striking person. Moreover, his attitude<br>to Kitty in the past--the attitude of a grown-up person to a<br>child, arising from his friendship with her brother--seemed to<br>him yet another obstacle to love. An ugly, good-natured man, as<br>he considered himself, might, he supposed, be liked as a friend;<br>but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved<br>Kitty, one would need to be a handsome and, still more, a<br>distinguished man.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p218" href="#p218" title="Paragraph 218"></a>He had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men,<br>but he did not believe it, for he judged by himself, and he could<br>not himself have loved any but beautiful, mysterious, and<br>exceptional women.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p219" href="#p219" title="Paragraph 219"></a>But after spending two months alone in the country, he was<br>convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he had<br>had experience in his early youth; that this feeling gave him not<br>an instant's rest; that he could not live without deciding the<br>question, would she or would she not be his wife, and that his<br>despair had arisen only from his own imaginings, that he had no<br>sort of proof that he would be rejected. And he had now come to<br>Moscow with a firm determination to make an offer, and get<br>married if he were accepted. Or...he could not conceive what<br>would become of him if he were rejected.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p220" href="#p220" title="Paragraph 220"></a>Chapter 7</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p221" href="#p221" title="Paragraph 221"></a>On arriving in Moscow by a morning train, Levin had put up at the<br>house of his elder half-brother, Koznishev. After changing his<br>clothes he went down to his brother's study, intending to talk to<br>him at once about the object of his visit, and to ask his advice;<br>but his brother was not alone. With him there was a well-known<br>professor of philosophy, who had come from Harkov expressly to<br>clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very<br>important philosophical question. The professor was carrying on<br>a hot crusade against materialists. Sergey Koznishev had been<br>following this crusade with interest, and after reading the<br>professor's last article, he had written him a letter stating his<br>objections. He accused the professor of making too great<br>concessions to the materialists. And the professor had promptly<br>appeared to argue the matter out. The point in discussion was<br>the question then in vogue: Is there a line to be drawn between<br>psychological and physiological phenomena in man? and if so,<br>where?</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p222" href="#p222" title="Paragraph 222"></a>Sergey Ivanovitch met his brother with the smile of chilly<br>friendliness he always had for everyone, and introducing him to<br>the professor, went on with the conversation.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p223" href="#p223" title="Paragraph 223"></a>A little man in spectacles, with a narrow forehead, tore himself<br>from the discussion for an instant to greet Levin, and then went<br>on talking without paying any further attention to him. Levin<br>sat down to wait till the professor should go, but he soon began<br>to get interested in the subject under discussion.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p224" href="#p224" title="Paragraph 224"></a>Levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were<br>disputing, and had read them, interested in them as a development<br>of the first principles of science, familiar to him as a natural<br>science student at the university. But he had never connected<br>these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal,<br>as to reflex action, biology, and sociology, with those questions<br>as to the meaning of life and death to himself, which had of late<br>been more and more often in his mind.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p225" href="#p225" title="Paragraph 225"></a>As he listened to his brother's argument with the professor, he<br>noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those<br>spiritual problems, that at times they almost touched on the<br>latter; but every time they were close upon what seemed to him<br>the chief point, they promptly beat a hasty retreat, and plunged<br>again into a sea of subtle distinctions, reservations,<br>quotations, allusions, and appeals to authorities, and it was<br>with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p226" href="#p226" title="Paragraph 226"></a>"I cannot admit it," said Sergey Ivanovitch, with his habitual<br>clearness, precision of expression, and elegance of phrase. "I<br>cannot in any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of<br>the external world has been derived from perceptions. The most<br>fundamental idea, the idea of existence, has not been received by<br>me through sensation; indeed, there is no special sense-organ for<br>the transmission of such an idea."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p227" href="#p227" title="Paragraph 227"></a>"Yes, but they--Wurt, and Knaust, and Pripasov--would answer<br>that your consciousness of existence is derived from the<br>conjunction of all your sensations, that that consciousness of<br>existence is the result of your sensations. Wurt, indeed, says<br>plainly that, assuming there are no sensations, it follows that<br>there is no idea of existence."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p228" href="#p228" title="Paragraph 228"></a>"I maintain the contrary," began Sergey Ivanovitch.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p229" href="#p229" title="Paragraph 229"></a>But here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the<br>real point of the matter, they were again retreating, and he made<br>up his mind to put a question to the professor.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p230" href="#p230" title="Paragraph 230"></a>"According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body is<br>dead, I can have no existence of any sort?" he queried.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p231" href="#p231" title="Paragraph 231"></a>The professor, in annoyance, and, as it were, mental suffering<br>at the interruption, looked round at the strange inquirer, more<br>like a bargeman than a philosopher, and turned his eyes upon<br>Sergey Ivanovitch, as though to ask: What's one to say to him?<br>But Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been talking with far less heat<br>and one-sidedness than the professor, and who had sufficient<br>breadth of mind to answer the professor, and at the same time to<br>comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the<br>question was put, smiled and said:</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p232" href="#p232" title="Paragraph 232"></a>"That question we have no right to answer as yet."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p233" href="#p233" title="Paragraph 233"></a>"We have not the requisite data," chimed in the professor, and he<br>went back to his argument. "No," he said; "I would point out the<br>fact that if, as Pripasov directly asserts, perception is based<br>on sensation, then we are bound to distinguish sharply between<br>these two conceptions."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p234" href="#p234" title="Paragraph 234"></a>Levin listened no more, and simply waited for the professor to<br>go.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p235" href="#p235" title="Paragraph 235"></a>Chapter 8</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p236" href="#p236" title="Paragraph 236"></a>When the professor had gone, Sergey Ivanovitch turned to his<br>brother.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p237" href="#p237" title="Paragraph 237"></a>"Delighted that you've come. For some time, is it? How's your<br>farming getting on?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p238" href="#p238" title="Paragraph 238"></a>Levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in<br>farming, and only put the question in deference to him, and so he<br>only told him about the sale of his wheat and money matters.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p239" href="#p239" title="Paragraph 239"></a>Levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get<br>married, and to ask his advice; he had indeed firmly resolved to<br>do so. But after seeing his brother, listening to his<br>conversation with the professor, hearing afterwards the<br>unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother questioned<br>him about agricultural matters (their mother's property had not<br>been divided, and Levin took charge of both their shares), Levin<br>felt that he could not for some reason begin to talk to him of<br>his intention of marrying. He felt that his brother would not<br>look at it as he would have wished him to.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p240" href="#p240" title="Paragraph 240"></a>"Well, how is your district council doing?" asked Sergey<br>Ivanovitch, who was greatly interested in these local boards and<br>attached great importance to them.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p241" href="#p241" title="Paragraph 241"></a>"I really don't know."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p242" href="#p242" title="Paragraph 242"></a>"What! Why, surely you're a member of the board?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p243" href="#p243" title="Paragraph 243"></a>"No, I'm not a member now; I've resigned," answered Levin, "and I<br>no longer attend the meetings."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p244" href="#p244" title="Paragraph 244"></a>"What a pity!" commented Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p245" href="#p245" title="Paragraph 245"></a>Levin in self-defense began to describe what took place in the<br>meetings in his district.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p246" href="#p246" title="Paragraph 246"></a>"That's how it always is!" Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him.<br>"We Russians are always like that. Perhaps it's our strong<br>point, really, the faculty of seeing our own shortcomings; but we<br>overdo it, we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have<br>on the tip of our tongues. All I say is, give such rights as our<br>local self-government to any other European people--why, the<br>Germans or the English would have worked their way to freedom<br>from them, while we simply turn them into ridicule."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p247" href="#p247" title="Paragraph 247"></a>"But how can it be helped?" said Levin penitently. "It was my<br>last effort. And I did try with all my soul. I can't. I'm no<br>good at it."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p248" href="#p248" title="Paragraph 248"></a>"It's not that you're no good at it," said Sergey Ivanovitch; "it<br>is that you don't look at it as you should."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p249" href="#p249" title="Paragraph 249"></a>"Perhaps not," Levin answered dejectedly.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p250" href="#p250" title="Paragraph 250"></a>"Oh! do you know brother Nikolay's turned up again?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p251" href="#p251" title="Paragraph 251"></a>This brother Nikolay was the elder brother of Konstantin Levin,<br>and half-brother of Sergey Ivanovitch; a man utterly ruined, who<br>had dissipated the greater part of his fortune, was living in the<br>strangest and lowest company, and had quarreled with his<br>brothers.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p252" href="#p252" title="Paragraph 252"></a>"What did you say?" Levin cried with horror. "How do you know?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p253" href="#p253" title="Paragraph 253"></a>"Prokofy saw him in the street."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p254" href="#p254" title="Paragraph 254"></a>"Here in Moscow? Where is he? Do you know?" Levin got up from<br>his chair, as though on the point of starting off at once.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p255" href="#p255" title="Paragraph 255"></a>"I am sorry I told you," said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his head<br>at his younger brother's excitement. "I sent to find out where<br>he is living, and sent him his IOU to Trubin, which I paid. This<br>is the answer he sent me."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p256" href="#p256" title="Paragraph 256"></a>And Sergey Ivanovitch took a note from under a paper-weight and<br>handed it to his brother.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p257" href="#p257" title="Paragraph 257"></a>Levin read in the queer, familiar handwriting: "I humbly beg you<br>to leave me in peace. That's the only favor I ask of my gracious<br>brothers.--Nikolay Levin."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p258" href="#p258" title="Paragraph 258"></a>Levin read it, and without raising his head stood with the note<br>in his hands opposite Sergey Ivanovitch.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p259" href="#p259" title="Paragraph 259"></a>There was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget<br>his unhappy brother for the time, and the consciousness that it<br>would be base to do so.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p260" href="#p260" title="Paragraph 260"></a>"He obviously wants to offend me," pursued Sergey Ivanovitch;<br>"but he cannot offend me, and I should have wished with all my<br>heart to assist him, but I know it's impossible to do that."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p261" href="#p261" title="Paragraph 261"></a>"Yes, yes," repeated Levin. "I understand and appreciate your<br>attitude to him; but I shall go and see him."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p262" href="#p262" title="Paragraph 262"></a>"If you want to, do; but I shouldn't advise it," said Sergey<br>Ivanovitch. "As regards myself, I have no fear of your doing so;<br>he will not make you quarrel with me; but for your own sake, I<br>should say you would do better not to go. You can't do him any<br>good; still, do as you please."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p263" href="#p263" title="Paragraph 263"></a>"Very likely I can't do any good, but I feel--especially at such<br>a moment--but that's another thing--I feel I could not be at<br>peace."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p264" href="#p264" title="Paragraph 264"></a>"Well, that I don't understand," said Sergey Ivanovitch. "One<br>thing I do understand," he added; "it's a lesson in humility. I<br>have come to look very differently and more charitably on what is<br>called infamous since brother Nikolay has become what he is...you<br>know what he did..."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p265" href="#p265" title="Paragraph 265"></a>"Oh, it's awful, awful!" repeated Levin.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p266" href="#p266" title="Paragraph 266"></a>After obtaining his brother's address from Sergey Ivanovitch's<br>footman, Levin was on the point of setting off at once to see<br>him, but on second thought he decided to put off his visit till<br>the evening. The first thing to do to set his heart at rest was<br>to accomplish what he had come to Moscow for. From his brother's<br>Levin went to Oblonsky's office, and on getting news of the<br>Shtcherbatskys from him, he drove to the place where he had been<br>told he might find Kitty.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p267" href="#p267" title="Paragraph 267"></a>Chapter 9</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p268" href="#p268" title="Paragraph 268"></a>At four o'clock, conscious of his throbbing heart, Levin stepped<br>out of a hired sledge at the Zoological Gardens, and turned along<br>the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground, knowing<br>that he would certainly find her there, as he had seen the<br>Shtcherbatskys' carriage at the entrance.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p269" href="#p269" title="Paragraph 269"></a>It was a bright, frosty day. Rows of carriages, sledges,<br>drivers, and policemen were standing in the approach. Crowds of<br>well-dressed people, with hats bright in the sun, swarmed about<br>the entrance and along the well-swept little paths between the<br>little houses adorned with carving in the Russian style. The old<br>curly birches of the gardens, all their twigs laden with snow,<br>looked as though freshly decked in sacred vestments.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p270" href="#p270" title="Paragraph 270"></a>He walked along the path towards the skating-ground, and kept<br>saying to himself--"You mustn't be excited, you must be calm.<br>What's the matter with you? What do you want? Be quiet,<br>stupid," he conjured his heart. And the more he tried to compose<br>himself, the more breathless he found himself. An acquaintance<br>met him and called him by his name, but Levin did not even<br>recognize him. He went towards the mounds, whence came the clank<br>of the chains of sledges as they slipped down or were dragged up,<br>the rumble of the sliding sledges, and the sounds of merry<br>voices. He walked on a few steps, and the skating-ground lay<br>open before his eyes, and at once, amidst all the skaters, he<br>knew her.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p271" href="#p271" title="Paragraph 271"></a>He knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized<br>on his heart. She was standing talking to a lady at the opposite<br>end of the ground. There was apparently nothing striking either<br>in her dress or her attitude. But for Levin she was as easy to<br>find in that crowd as a rose among nettles. Everything was made<br>bright by her. She was the smile that shed light on all round<br>her. "Is it possible I can go over there on the ice, go up to<br>her?" he thought. The place where she stood seemed to him a holy<br>shrine, unapproachable, and there was one moment when he was<br>almost retreating, so overwhelmed was he with terror. He had to<br>make an effort to master himself, and to remind himself that<br>people of all sorts were moving about her, and that he too might<br>come there to skate. He walked down, for a long while avoiding<br>looking at her as at the sun, but seeing her, as one does the<br>sun, without looking.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p272" href="#p272" title="Paragraph 272"></a>On that day of the week and at that time of day people of one<br>set, all acquainted with one another, used to meet on the ice.<br>There were crack skaters there, showing off their skill, and<br>learners clinging to chairs with timid, awkward movements, boys,<br>and elderly people skating with hygienic motives. They seemed to<br>Levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here,<br>near her. All the skaters, it seemed, with perfect<br>self-possession, skated towards her, skated by her, even spoke to<br>her, and were happy, quite apart from her, enjoying the capital<br>ice and the fine weather.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p273" href="#p273" title="Paragraph 273"></a>Nikolay Shtcherbatsky, Kitty's cousin, in a short jacket and<br>tight trousers, was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on.<br>Seeing Levin, he shouted to him:</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p274" href="#p274" title="Paragraph 274"></a>"Ah, the first skater in Russia! Been here long? First-rate<br>ice--do put your skates on."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p275" href="#p275" title="Paragraph 275"></a>"I haven't got my skates," Levin answered, marveling at this<br>boldness and ease in her presence, and not for one second losing<br>sight of her, though he did not look at her. He felt as though<br>the sun were coming near him. She was in a corner, and turning<br>out her slender feet in their high boots with obvious timidity,<br>she skated towards him. A boy in Russian dress, desperately<br>waving his arms and bowed down to the ground, overtook her. She<br>skated a little uncertainly; taking her hands out of the little<br>muff that hung on a cord, she held them ready for emergency, and<br>looking towards Levin, whom she had recognized, she smiled at<br>him, and at her own fears. When she had got round the turn, she<br>gave herself a push off with one foot, and skated straight up to<br>Shtcherbatsky. Clutching at his arm, she nodded smiling to<br>Levin. She was more splendid that he had imagined her.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p276" href="#p276" title="Paragraph 276"></a>When he thought of her, he could call up a vivid picture of her<br>to himself, especially the charm of that little fair head, so<br>freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders, and so full of<br>childish brightness and good humor. The childishness of her<br>expression, together with the delicate beauty of her figure, made<br>up her special charm, and that he fully realized. But what<br>always struck him in her as something unlooked for, was the<br>expression of her eyes, soft, serene, and truthful, and above<br>all, her smile, which always transported Levin to an enchanted<br>world, where he felt himself softened and tender, as he<br>remembered himself in some days of his early childhood.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p277" href="#p277" title="Paragraph 277"></a>"Have you been here long?" she said, giving him her hand. "Thank<br>you," she added, as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen<br>out of her muff.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p278" href="#p278" title="Paragraph 278"></a>"I? I've not long...yesterday...I mean today...I arrived,"<br>answered Levin, in his emotion not at once understanding her<br>question. "I was meaning to come and see you," he said; and<br>then, recollecting with what intention he was trying to see her,<br>he was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p279" href="#p279" title="Paragraph 279"></a>"I didn't know you could skate, and skate so well."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p280" href="#p280" title="Paragraph 280"></a>She looked at him earnestly, as though wishing to make out the<br>cause of his confusion.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p281" href="#p281" title="Paragraph 281"></a>"Your praise is worth having. The tradition is kept up here that<br>you are the best of skaters," she said, with her little<br>black-gloved hand brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p282" href="#p282" title="Paragraph 282"></a>"Yes, I used once to skate with passion; I wanted to reach<br>perfection."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p283" href="#p283" title="Paragraph 283"></a>"You do everything with passion, I think," she said smiling. "I<br>should so like to see how you skate. Put on skates, and let us<br>skate together."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p284" href="#p284" title="Paragraph 284"></a>"Skate together! Can that be possible?" thought Levin, gazing at<br>her.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p285" href="#p285" title="Paragraph 285"></a>"I'll put them on directly," he said.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p286" href="#p286" title="Paragraph 286"></a>And he went off to get skates.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p287" href="#p287" title="Paragraph 287"></a>"It's a long while since we've seen you here, sir," said the<br>attendant, supporting his foot, and screwing on the heel of the<br>skate. "Except you, there's none of the gentlemen first-rate<br>skaters. Will that be all right?" said he, tightening the strap.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p288" href="#p288" title="Paragraph 288"></a>"Oh, yes, yes; make haste, please," answered Levin, with<br>difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would<br>overspread his face. "Yes," he thought, "this now is life, this<br>is happiness! Together, she said; let us skate together! Speak<br>to her now? But that's just why I'm afraid to speak--because I'm<br>happy now, happy in hope, anyway.... And then?.... But I must!<br>I must! I must! Away with weakness!"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p289" href="#p289" title="Paragraph 289"></a>Levin rose to his feet, took off his overcoat, and scurrying over<br>the rough ice round the hut, came out on the smooth ice and<br>skated without effort, as it were, by simple exercise of will,<br>increasing and slackening speed and turning his course. He<br>approached with timidity, but again her smile reassured him.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p290" href="#p290" title="Paragraph 290"></a>She gave him her hand, and they set off side by side, going<br>faster and faster, and the more rapidly they moved the more<br>tightly she grasped his hand.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p291" href="#p291" title="Paragraph 291"></a>"With you I should soon learn; I somehow feel confidence in you,"<br>she said to him.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p292" href="#p292" title="Paragraph 292"></a>"And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me," he<br>said, but was at once panic-stricken at what he had said, and<br>blushed. And indeed, no sooner had he uttered these words, when<br>all at once, like the sun going behind a cloud, her face lost all<br>its friendliness, and Levin detected the familiar change in her<br>expression that denoted the working of thought; a crease showed<br>on her smooth brow.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p293" href="#p293" title="Paragraph 293"></a>"Is there anything troubling you?--though I've no right to ask<br>such a question," he added hurriedly.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p294" href="#p294" title="Paragraph 294"></a>"Oh, why so?.... No, I have nothing to trouble me," she<br>responded coldly; and she added immediately: "You haven't seen<br>Mlle. Linon, have you?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p295" href="#p295" title="Paragraph 295"></a>"Not yet."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p296" href="#p296" title="Paragraph 296"></a>"Go and speak to her, she likes you so much."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p297" href="#p297" title="Paragraph 297"></a>"What's wrong? I have offended her. Lord help me!" thought<br>Levin, and he flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray<br>ringlets, who was sitting on a bench. Smiling and showing her<br>false teeth, she greeted him as an old friend.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p298" href="#p298" title="Paragraph 298"></a>"Yes, you see we're growing up," she said to him, glancing<br>towards Kitty, "and growing old. Tiny bear has grown big now!"<br>pursued the Frenchwoman, laughing, and she reminded him of his<br>joke about the three young ladies whom he had compared to the<br>three bears in the English nursery tale. "Do you remember that's<br>what you used to call them?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p299" href="#p299" title="Paragraph 299"></a>He remembered absolutely nothing, but she had been laughing at<br>the joke for ten years now, and was fond of it.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p300" href="#p300" title="Paragraph 300"></a>"Now, go and skate, go and skate. Our Kitty has learned to skate<br>nicely, hasn't she?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p301" href="#p301" title="Paragraph 301"></a>When Levin darted up to Kitty her face was no longer stern; her<br>eyes looked at him with the same sincerity and friendliness, but<br>Levin fancied that in her friendliness there was a certain note<br>of deliberate composure. And he felt depressed. After talking a<br>little of her old governess and her peculiarities, she questioned<br>him about his life.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p302" href="#p302" title="Paragraph 302"></a>"Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren't<br>you?" she said.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p303" href="#p303" title="Paragraph 303"></a>"No, I'm not dull, I am very busy," he said, feeling that she was<br>holding him in check by her composed tone, which he would not<br>have the force to break through, just as it had been at the<br>beginning of the winter.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p304" href="#p304" title="Paragraph 304"></a>"Are you going to stay in town long?" Kitty questioned him.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p305" href="#p305" title="Paragraph 305"></a>"I don't know," he answered, not thinking of what he was saying.<br>The thought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet<br>friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding<br>anything came into his mind, and he resolved to make a struggle<br>against it.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p306" href="#p306" title="Paragraph 306"></a>"How is it you don't know?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p307" href="#p307" title="Paragraph 307"></a>"I don't know. It depends upon you," he said, and was<br>immediately horror-stricken at his own words.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p308" href="#p308" title="Paragraph 308"></a>Whether it was that she had heard his words, or that she did not<br>want to hear them, she made a sort of stumble, twice struck out,<br>and hurriedly skated away from him. She skated up to Mlle.<br>Linon, said something to her, and went towards the pavilion where<br>the ladies took off their skates.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p309" href="#p309" title="Paragraph 309"></a>"My God! what have I done! Merciful God! help me, guide me,"<br>said Levin, praying inwardly, and at the same time, feeling a<br>need of violent exercise, he skated about describing inner and<br>outer circles.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p310" href="#p310" title="Paragraph 310"></a>At that moment one of the young men, the best of the skaters of<br>the day, came out of the coffee-house in his skates, with a<br>cigarette in his mouth. Taking a run, he dashed down the steps<br>in his skates, crashing and bounding up and down. He flew down,<br>and without even changing the position of his hands, skated away<br>over the ice.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p311" href="#p311" title="Paragraph 311"></a>"Ah, that's a new trick!" said Levin, and he promptly ran up to<br>the top to do this new trick.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p312" href="#p312" title="Paragraph 312"></a>"Don't break you neck! it needs practice!" Nikolay Shtcherbatsky<br>shouted after him.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p313" href="#p313" title="Paragraph 313"></a>Levin went to the steps, took a run from above as best he could,<br>and dashed down, preserving his balance in this unwonted movement<br>with his hands. On the last step he stumbled, but barely<br>touching the ice with his hand, with a violent effort recovered<br>himself, and skated off, laughing.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p314" href="#p314" title="Paragraph 314"></a>"How splendid, how nice he is!" Kitty was thinking at that time,<br>as she came out of the pavilion with Mlle. Linon, and looked<br>towards him with a smile of quiet affection, as though he were a<br>favorite brother. "And can it be my fault, can I have done<br>anything wrong? They talk of flirtation. I know it's not he<br>that I love; but still I am happy with him, and he's so jolly.<br>Only, why did he say that?..." she mused.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p315" href="#p315" title="Paragraph 315"></a>Catching sight of Kitty going away, and her mother meeting her at<br>the steps, Levin, flushed from his rapid exercise, stood still<br>and pondered a minute. He took off his skates, and overtook the<br>mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p316" href="#p316" title="Paragraph 316"></a>"Delighted to see you," said Princess Shtcherbatskaya. "On<br>Thursdays we are home, as always."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p317" href="#p317" title="Paragraph 317"></a>"Today, then?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p318" href="#p318" title="Paragraph 318"></a>"We shall be pleased to see you," the princess said stiffly.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p319" href="#p319" title="Paragraph 319"></a>This stiffness hurt Kitty, and she could not resist the desire to<br>smooth over her mother's coldness. She turned her head, and with<br>a smile said:</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p320" href="#p320" title="Paragraph 320"></a>"Good-bye till this evening."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p321" href="#p321" title="Paragraph 321"></a>At that moment Stepan Arkadyevitch, his hat cocked on one side,<br>with beaming face and eyes, strode into the garden like a<br>conquering hero. But as he approached his mother-in-law, he<br>responded in a mournful and crestfallen tone to her inquiries<br>about Dolly's health. After a little subdued and dejected<br>conversation with his mother-in-law, he threw out his chest<br>again, and put his arm in Levin's.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p322" href="#p322" title="Paragraph 322"></a>"Well, shall we set off?" he asked. "I've been thinking about<br>you all this time, and I'm very, very glad you've come," he said,<br>looking him in the face with a significant air.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p323" href="#p323" title="Paragraph 323"></a>"Yes, come along," answered Levin in ecstasy, hearing unceasingly<br>the sound of that voice saying, "Good-bye till this evening," and<br>seeing the smile with which it was said.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p324" href="#p324" title="Paragraph 324"></a>"To the England or the Hermitage?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p325" href="#p325" title="Paragraph 325"></a>"I don't mind which."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p326" href="#p326" title="Paragraph 326"></a>"All right, then, the England," said Stepan Arkadyevitch,<br>selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the<br>Hermitage, and consequently considered it mean to avoid it.<br>"Have you got a sledge? That's first-rate, for I sent my<br>carriage home."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p327" href="#p327" title="Paragraph 327"></a>The friends hardly spoke all the way. Levin was wondering what<br>that change in Kitty's expression had meant, and alternately<br>assuring himself that there was hope, and falling into despair,<br>seeing clearly that his hopes were insane, and yet all the while<br>he felt himself quite another man, utterly unlike what he had<br>been before her smile and those words, "Good-bye till this<br>evening."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p328" href="#p328" title="Paragraph 328"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing<br>the menu of the dinner.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p329" href="#p329" title="Paragraph 329"></a>"You like trout, don't you?" he said to Levin as they were<br>arriving.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p330" href="#p330" title="Paragraph 330"></a>"Eh?" responded Levin. "Turbot? Yes, I'm AWFULLY fond of<br>turbot."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p331" href="#p331" title="Paragraph 331"></a>Chapter 10</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p332" href="#p332" title="Paragraph 332"></a>When Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky, he could not<br>help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression, as it were, a<br>restrained radiance, about the face and whole figure of Stepan<br>Arkadyevitch. Oblonsky took off his overcoat, and with his hat<br>over one ear walked into the dining room, giving directions to<br>the Tatar waiters, who were clustered about him in evening coats,<br>bearing napkins. Bowing to right and left to the people he met,<br>and here as everywhere joyously greeting acquaintances, he went<br>up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer of fish and<br>vodka, and said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in ribbons,<br>lace, and ringlets, behind the counter, something so amusing that<br>even that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter. Levin for<br>his part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt<br>such a loathing of that Frenchwoman, all made up, it seemed, of<br>false hair, poudre de riz, and vinaigre de toilette. He made<br>haste to move away from her, as from a dirty place. His whole<br>soul was filled with memories of Kitty, and there was a smile of<br>triumph and happiness shining in his eyes.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p333" href="#p333" title="Paragraph 333"></a>"This way, your excellency, please. Your excellency won't be<br>disturbed here," said a particularly pertinacious, white-headed<br>old Tatar with immense hips and coattails gaping widely behind.<br>"Walk in, your excellency," he said to Levin; by way of showing<br>his respect to Stepan Arkadyevitch, being attentive to his guest<br>as well.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p334" href="#p334" title="Paragraph 334"></a>Instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the<br>bronze chandelier, though it already had a table cloth on it, he<br>pushed up velvet chairs, and came to a standstill before Stepan<br>Arkadyevitch with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands,<br>awaiting his commands.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p335" href="#p335" title="Paragraph 335"></a>"If you prefer it, your excellency, a private room will be free<br>directly; Prince Golistin with a lady. Fresh oysters have come<br>in."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p336" href="#p336" title="Paragraph 336"></a>"Ah! oysters."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p337" href="#p337" title="Paragraph 337"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p338" href="#p338" title="Paragraph 338"></a>"How if we were to change our program, Levin?" he said keeping<br>his finger on the bill of fare. And his face expressed serious<br>hesitation. "Are the oysters good? Mind now."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p339" href="#p339" title="Paragraph 339"></a>"They're Flensburg, your excellency. We've no Ostend."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p340" href="#p340" title="Paragraph 340"></a>"Flensburg will do, but are they fresh?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p341" href="#p341" title="Paragraph 341"></a>"Only arrived yesterday."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p342" href="#p342" title="Paragraph 342"></a>"Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change<br>the whole program? Eh?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p343" href="#p343" title="Paragraph 343"></a>"It's all the same to me. I should like cabbage soup and<br>porridge better than anything; but of course there's nothing like<br>that here."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p344" href="#p344" title="Paragraph 344"></a>"Porridge a la Russe, your honor would like?" said the Tatar,<br>bending down to Levin, like a nurse speaking to a child.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p345" href="#p345" title="Paragraph 345"></a>"No, joking apart, whatever you choose is sure to be good. I've<br>been skating, and I'm hungry. And don't imagine," he added,<br>detecting a look of dissatisfaction on Oblonsky's face, "that I<br>shan't appreciate your choice. I am fond of good things."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p346" href="#p346" title="Paragraph 346"></a>"I should hope so! After all, it's one of the pleasures of<br>life," said Stepan Arkadyevitch. "Well, then, my friend, you<br>give us two--or better say three--dozen oysters, clear soup<br>with vegetables..."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p347" href="#p347" title="Paragraph 347"></a>"Printaniere," prompted the Tatar. But Stepan Arkadyevitch<br>apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving<br>the French names of the dishes.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p348" href="#p348" title="Paragraph 348"></a>"With vegetables in it, you know. Then turbot with thick sauce,<br>then...roast beef; and mind it's good. Yes, and capons, perhaps,<br>and then sweets."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p349" href="#p349" title="Paragraph 349"></a>The Tatar, recollecting that it was Stepan Arkadyevitch's way not<br>to call the dishes by the names in the French bill of fare, did<br>not repeat them after him, but could not resist rehearsing the<br>whole menus to himself according to the bill:--"Soupe<br>printaniere, turbot, sauce Beaumarchais, poulard a l'estragon,<br>macedoine de fruits...etc.," and then instantly, as though worked<br>by springs, laying down one bound bill of fare, he took up<br>another, the list of wines, and submitted it to Stepan<br>Arkadyevitch.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p350" href="#p350" title="Paragraph 350"></a>"What shall we drink?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p351" href="#p351" title="Paragraph 351"></a>"What you like, only not too much. Champagne," said Levin.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p352" href="#p352" title="Paragraph 352"></a>"What! to start with? You're right though, I dare say. Do you<br>like the white seal?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p353" href="#p353" title="Paragraph 353"></a>"Cachet blanc," prompted the Tatar.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p354" href="#p354" title="Paragraph 354"></a>"Very well, then, give us that brand with the oysters, and then<br>we'll see."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p355" href="#p355" title="Paragraph 355"></a>"Yes, sir. And what table wine?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p356" href="#p356" title="Paragraph 356"></a>"You can give us Nuits. Oh, no, better the classic Chablis."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p357" href="#p357" title="Paragraph 357"></a>"Yes, sir. And YOUR cheese, your excellency?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p358" href="#p358" title="Paragraph 358"></a>"Oh, yes, Parmesan. Or would you like another?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p359" href="#p359" title="Paragraph 359"></a>"No, it's all the same to me," said Levin, unable to suppress a<br>smile.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p360" href="#p360" title="Paragraph 360"></a>And the Tatar ran off with flying coattails, and in five minutes<br>darted in with a dish of opened oysters on mother-of-pearl<br>shells, and a bottle between his fingers.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p361" href="#p361" title="Paragraph 361"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin, tucked it into<br>his waistcoat, and settling his arms comfortably, started on the<br>oysters.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p362" href="#p362" title="Paragraph 362"></a>"Not bad," he said, stripping the oysters from the pearly shell<br>with a silver fork, and swallowing them one after another. "Not<br>bad," he repeated, turning his dewy, brilliant eyes from Levin to<br>the Tatar.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p363" href="#p363" title="Paragraph 363"></a>Levin ate the oysters indeed, though white bread and cheese would<br>have pleased him better. But he was admiring Oblonsky. Even the<br>Tatar, uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into<br>the delicate glasses, glanced at Stepan Arkadyevitch, and settled<br>his white cravat with a perceptible smile of satisfaction.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p364" href="#p364" title="Paragraph 364"></a>"You don't care much for oysters, do you?" said Stepan<br>Arkadyevitch, emptying his wine glass, "or you're worried about<br>something. Eh?"</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p365" href="#p365" title="Paragraph 365"></a>He wanted Levin to be in good spirits. But it was not that Levin<br>was not in good spirits; he was ill at ease. With what he had in<br>his soul, he felt sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant, in<br>the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies, in<br>all this fuss and bustle; the surroundings of bronzes, looking<br>glasses, gas, and waiters--all of it was offensive to him. He<br>was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p366" href="#p366" title="Paragraph 366"></a>"I? Yes, I am; but besides, all this bothers me," he said. "You<br>can't conceive how queer it all seems to a country person like<br>me, as queer as that gentleman's nails I saw at your place..."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p367" href="#p367" title="Paragraph 367"></a>"Yes, I saw how much interested you were in poor Grinevitch's<br>nails," said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p368" href="#p368" title="Paragraph 368"></a>"It's too much for me," responded Levin. "Do try, now, and put<br>yourself in my place, take the point of view of a country person.<br>We in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as<br>will be most convenient for working with. So we cut our nails;<br>sometimes we turn up our sleeves. And here people purposely let<br>their nails grow as long as they will, and link on small saucers<br>by way of studs, so that they can do nothing with their hands."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p369" href="#p369" title="Paragraph 369"></a>Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled gaily.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p370" href="#p370" title="Paragraph 370"></a>"Oh, yes, that's just a sign that he has no need to do coarse<br>work. His work is with the mind..."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p371" href="#p371" title="Paragraph 371"></a>"Maybe. But still it's queer to me, just as at this moment it<br>seems queer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over<br>as soon as we can, so as to be ready for our work, while here are<br>we trying to drag out our meal as long as possible, and with that<br>object eating oysters..."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p372" href="#p372" title="Paragraph 372"></a>"Why, of course," objected Stepan Arkadyevitch. "But that's just<br>the aim of civilization--to make everything a source of<br>enjoyment."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p373" href="#p373" title="Paragraph 373"></a>"Well, if that's its aim, I'd rather be a savage."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p374" href="#p374" title="Paragraph 374"></a>"And so you are a savage. All you Levins are savages."</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="p375" href="#p375" title="Paragraph 375"></a>Levin sighed.
